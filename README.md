Before starting the code, in order to access the GUI version:
(if you have Python installed)
Open the console (terminal).

For windows:
Win+R. Then type 'cmd'.
In the console write 'pip install customtkinter' and wait for the installation to complete.

For MacOS:
Command+Space. Then type 'terminal'.
In the console write 'pip3 install customtkinter' and 'pip3 install packaging'


Now, the guide for the code:
Input: In the upper entry field, input grades (no matter percentage or decimal form, both 90 and 0.9 give same result) with space as a separator
Input 2: In the lower entry field, input desirable overall grade (in the same format as in the upper entry field, if in upper the
percentage/decimal form is given, same should be here)

Button: click for the overall to be calculated

Label: The result (required grade on the Final Exam) will be provided here after pressing the Button

Note: If you use wrong separator, or input a letter/unnecessary symbol, nothing will work. If different formats of grades are given, result
will be inaccurate.
